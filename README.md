# Two layer Neural Network
 ## Description
  This is a homework assignment given to me for the course BBM103 Introduction to Programming Course Lab.
  This project detects if the given image is a cat image or not by using two layer neural network structure.
  In this project I was expected to use numpy and multidimensional arrays to create two layer neural network. 
## Requeriments
